2023.04.30;16:18:23;User;What would be your suggestion to avoid migraine?
2023.04.30;16:18:29;AI Doktor; Migraines can be managed with prescription medication, relaxation techniques and lifestyle changes. You should start by avoiding potential triggers such as certain foods or stress. Make sure to get plenty of rest, avoid foods that include monosodium glutamate, caffeine and processed meats and drinks. Exercise regularly, practice stress-relieving activities, such as yoga or deep breathing, and use relaxation methods such as yoga, massage therapy, acupuncture or biofeedback to reduce tension.
