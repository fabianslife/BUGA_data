In the meantime, try to remain hydrated and get enough rest. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen are also helpful in relieving some headache symptoms.

2023.08.10;14:32:09;AI Doktor; It sounds like you may be experiencing a tension headache which can be caused by a variety of factors- such as stress, poor posture, dehydration, or lack of sleep. To help alleviate the symptoms, it is important to practice good posture, get enough rest, and manage stress. Regular exercise can also be beneficial. You can take over the counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief. Additionally, relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga may help reduce the overall level of tension.
