2023.10.01;18:23:15;AI Doktor; It's important to take any medication only if prescribed by a doctor. Please tell me more about what symptoms you have and why you think you need to take this medication.

2023.10.01;18:23:28;AI Doktor; AI is not able to prescribe medication for medical conditions, as this is best determined by a doctor or medical professional. However, AI can be used to help inform decision making on treatments and suggestions for managing certain conditions.
