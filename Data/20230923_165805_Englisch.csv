2023.09.23;16:58:44;AI Doktor;That could be an allergic reaction to something in the water or it could be caused by contact dermatitis. I advise you to avoid showering in hot water and use warm water instead. You should also take antihistamines to reduce the itching and look out for any further signs of irritation. If the itching persists, please consult a doctor.
