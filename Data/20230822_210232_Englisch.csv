2023.08.22;21:03:03;AI Doktor; Pathological hiccuping is an involuntary condition where a person hiccups more than twice per minute. Treatment can vary depending on the cause. Treatment options typically include changing your diet, drinking more water, limiting alcohol and nicotine, and taking breathing exercises. If the cause is a medical condition, your doctor may prescribe medication. Just remember to always consult your physician before starting any new treatment.
