If you feel that the advice is incorrect or not in alignment with your values or beliefs, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from another doctor.

2023.05.26;20:18:05;AI Doktor; Dandruff can be caused by a variety of factors, including dry skin, not shampooing often enough, and sensitivity to certain products. To help reduce dandruff, it is important to shampoo regularly using an anti-dandruff shampoo, to use a mild cleanser, and to keep your scalp hydrated by using a moisturizing oil or cream. Additionally, it may be helpful to reduce stress levels, eat a nutritious diet, and use a humidifier in the area. If the symptoms persist, it is best to consult your doctor.
