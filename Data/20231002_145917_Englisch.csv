2023.10.02;14:59:44;AI Doktor; Hemorrhoids can be treated in several ways, depending on their severity. Mild symptoms can be relieved with over-the-counter creams, gels, or suppositories. In more severe cases, your physician may suggest minimally-invasive procedures, such as rubber band ligation, or more serious surgeries, such as a hemorrhoidectomy.

2023.10.02;15:00:29;AI Doktor; It is possible that you may be suffering from an overactive bladder. This is a medical condition where the bladder contracts more than normal and increases the urge to urinate. Treatment for an overactive bladder can involve changes in diet, medications, and bladder exercises. Types of medications used can include anticholinergics and/or mirabegon. Additionally, it may be beneficial to do pelvic floor muscle exercises to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles to improve bladder control.
