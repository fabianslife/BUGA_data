2023.09.12;15:06:08;AI Doktor; I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the pain? Does it feel sharp or dull, and where exactly is the pain located?
2023.09.12;15:06:25;User;it's sharp when i when i turn my neck to the right
2023.09.12;15:06:27;AI Doktor; It is possible that this could be a musculoskeletal injury or strain that has occurred in the neck muscles and tendons. I recommend that you avoid any movements that cause pain and rest your neck, using a heating pad to reduce the pain. After a few days, if the pain does not decrease, then you should see your doctor for further evaluation.
2023.09.12;15:07:09;User;Can I have coronavirus?
2023.09.12;15:07:11;AI Doktor; Since there is no physical examination performed, I am unable to determine if you could have coronavirus. It is important to watch for any signs of respiratory illness, such as a fever or difficulty breathing. If you have any of these symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor to get tested for coronavirus.
