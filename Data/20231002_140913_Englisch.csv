2023.10.02;14:09:28;AI Doktor;Hello, I'm sorry to hear that your legs are hurting. It would be helpful to know what type of pain you are experiencing, such as a dull ache, sharp and stabbing pain, or burning sensation. It would also be helpful to know when the pain began and what other symptoms you may be experiencing such as swelling or redness. Please let me know so that I can provide the best advice.

2023.10.02;14:09:57;AI Doktor;It sounds like you may be experiencing a sharp, stabbing pain that started five days ago. Can you describe the area in which you experience the pain? Is there any redness or swelling in the area, or any other symptoms such as difficulty walking? It would also be helpful to know if you are taking any pain medications or if you have recently had any injuries or illnesses.
