2023.08.15;16:52:15;AI Doktor;It sounds like you may have a tension headache. Tension headaches are caused by stress and tension on the muscles in the head and neck. You may experience a dull, pressure-like pain with a feeling of tightness around the forehead or on the sides and back of the head. Treatment for tension headache typically involves relieving stress and relaxing the tense muscles. Over-the-counter medications are usually enough to relieve the pain. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe medications or physical therapy.
