2023.09.24;19:17:16;AI Doktor; It sounds like you are struggling to maintain an erection. This can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, or hormonal imbalances. I would recommend that you make an appointment with your primary care provider for a physical exam and possibly further testing to determine the cause. In the meantime, there are lifestyle changes that you can make to improve your erections, such as exercising regularly and reducing stress.

2023.09.24;19:17:52;AI Doktor; Acne can be caused by hormonal imbalances, especially during puberty. To try to minimize the outbreaks, minimizing oil and dirt buildup on your skin, using a gentle exfoliation, and moisturizing regularly can help. Also, avoiding certain foods and drinking lots of water can also help. Additionally, your primary care provider may be able to prescribe medications to help better regulate your hormones.

2023.09.24;19:18:21;AI Doktor; My apologies if my recommendations sounded superficial. I am providing you with general tips that may help with your acne and other symptoms. However if you would like more specific advice, it would be best to schedule an appointment with your primary care provider. They can conduct a physical exam, review your medical history, and order any tests which may help pinpoint your condition.
