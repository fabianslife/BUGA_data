2023.09.23;14:06:14;AI Doktor; It's important to determine the underlying cause before seeking treatment for hair loss. Common causes such as genetics, hormonal imbalances, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, certain medications, illnesses, and stress could be considered. You may want to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss possible treatments based on the underlying cause.
