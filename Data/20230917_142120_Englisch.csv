2023.09.17;14:22:18;AI Doktor; It is possible that you are shivering during sleep due to a disturbance in your body's temperature regulation. There are a number of possible causes for this, including low blood sugar levels, being too cold, or even a side effect of certain medications. It would be good to rule out any potential medical causes. I suggest that you see a doctor for further evaluation.

2023.09.17;14:22:52;AI Doktor; It is possible that you are experiencing something called hypnagogic jerk or hypnic jerk, which is an involuntary muscle twitch or jerking that occurs during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. This is usually temporary and is not associated with any serious health conditions. However, if you experience this frequently or if it is interfering with your ability to get a good night's sleep, then it is recommended that you speak with your doctor for a more comprehensive evaluation.
