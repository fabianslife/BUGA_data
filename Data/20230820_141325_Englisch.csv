2023.08.20;14:13:56;AI Doktor; It's important to take good care of any wound in order to minimize the risk of infection. You should start by cleaning the wound with warm soapy water and then protecting it with a sterile bandage or dressing. If the wound is quite deep, you may need to see a doctor so that they can clean it and prescribe a suitable treatment.
