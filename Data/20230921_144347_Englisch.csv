2023.09.21;14:44:18;AI Doktor; Hello. Dysmenorrhea is a common condition characterized by cramping and pain during menstrual periods. To treat it, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as exercising, dietary changes, and relaxation techniques can be beneficial. If the symptoms don't improve or keep recurring, please consult your doctor for further investigation.
