2023.06.20;11:30:51;AI Doktor; It is important to identify what is causing your back pain. It is recommended to visit a doctor to diagnose the cause. Your doctor would likely ask questions about your pain, such as when it started, whether it is constantly present or intermittent, and what activities or positions tend to make it worse or better. Your doctor may offer treatment options based on how severe the pain is and the cause of the pain. Common strategies for treating back pain include pain medications, exercise and physical therapy, and in certain cases, surgery.
