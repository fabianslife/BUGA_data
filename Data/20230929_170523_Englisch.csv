2023.09.29;17:06:16;AI Doktor; Vertigo is a sense of dizziness or spinning. It can be a symptom of many medical conditions, some of which can be more serious than others. To help determine the cause of your vertigo, I recommend an evaluation by a doctor who can perform a medical history, physical examination, and/or tests. Treatment of vertigo depends on the underlying cause, so it's important to have a proper diagnosis first. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that cause dizziness or spinning, staying hydrated, getting adequate sleep, and avoiding alcohol or drug intake.
