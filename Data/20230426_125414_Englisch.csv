Possible physiological causes include imbalances of certain chemicals in the brain, as well as changes in the nervous system.

2023.04.26;12:55:50;AI Doktor; Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has already started being used in mental health settings. AI can be used to provide personalized symptoms assessments, help make diagnoses and provide treatment support, among other things. AI will never replace mental health professionals, however, as mental health care is a highly specialised field that requires empathy, warmth, and the ability to build strong relationships with patients. This sort of care must be driven by human involvement, which AI cannot replace.
