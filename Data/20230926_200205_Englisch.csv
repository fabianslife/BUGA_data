2023.09.26;20:02:42;AI Doktor; I'm sorry to hear that. First, it's important to stay calm. It could be a sign of a serious issue, such as a nosebleed, a brain aneurysm, or something else. You should seek medical attention immediately. It is important to get a thorough physical examination by a medical professional to determine the cause and properly treat the issue.

2023.09.26;20:02:58;AI Doktor; It's understandable that you are feeling anxious, but it is important to stay as calm as possible. Calling an ambulance is a good idea if it is available in your area. In the meantime, sit and try to relax. If you are bleeding from the nose, pinch the nostrils together and tilt your head forward. If the bleeding doesn't stop, seek medical attention as soon as possible.
