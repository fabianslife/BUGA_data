2023.05.15;19:30:26;AI Doktor; Yes, I am familiar with thyroid conditions. Could you tell me what symptoms you are experiencing that make you believe you may have a thyroid issue?
2023.05.15;19:30:47;User;Have headaches.
2023.05.15;19:30:54;AI Doktor; Headaches can sometimes be related to thyroid conditions. We would need to do more tests, like a blood test, to accurately diagnose a thyroid issue. In the meantime, it may be worth looking at what lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your headache frequency. Getting enough rest and hydration as well as avoiding known triggers could help to reduce headache severity.
