2023.09.21;11:25:45;AI Doktor; Hi! Could you tell me a bit more information about the pain you're experiencing? Where is the pain located, and when did it start? What kind of pain is it? Does anything make it worse or better?
2023.09.21;11:26:12;User;normally painters in the evening it's quite in the upper part of the abdomen and it makes them worse if i'm drinking beer or alcohol
2023.09.21;11:26:14;AI Doktor; It sounds like you may be experiencing gastritis or a stomach ulcer. I recommend avoiding anything that irritates the stomach including alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, and smoking. It would be best to keep track of your symptoms and contact your doctor for further diagnosis and treatment.
