2023.08.17;14:46:17;AI Doktor; Good morning. It is important to determine the source of your discomfort in order to properly treat you. Are you having any other symptoms, such as fever, difficulty breathing, or nausea?
2023.08.17;14:46:33;User;nausea and fever
2023.08.17;14:46:35;AI Doktor; Nausea and fever can be symptoms of a number of illnesses, such as the flu, food poisoning, or even a stomach virus. I suggest speaking to your doctor or an urgent care center to get a proper diagnosis. In the meantime, drinking plenty of fluids and resting can help you feel better.
2023.08.17;14:46:59;User;i also have tooth pain and swollen under my mandibula
2023.08.17;14:47:00;AI Doktor; Tooth pain and swelling under the mandible can be a sign of a dental issue, such as an infection or an abscess. I suggest seeing your dentist or an oral surgeon as soon as possible for an examination. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, can help reduce any discomfort in the meantime.
