2023.10.02;15:02:49;AI Doktor; It sounds like you may be experiencing gastrointestinal issues. It is difficult to diagnose without a physical examination, but some symptoms of abdominal discomfort can include abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. The yellow color may indicate that you are experiencing a medical condition known as jaundice. It is important that you seek an evaluation from an experienced physician who can investigate the cause of your abdominal discomfort and advise you on a suitable treatment plan.

2023.10.02;15:03:27;AI Doktor; It sounds like your dog may be experiencing an illness or upset stomach. Since I cannot confirm the cause of the vomiting without a physical examination, it is important that you contact your veterinarian or bring your dog in for an examination as soon as possible. They can provide additional assistance in determining the cause of the vomiting and the best course of action to take.
