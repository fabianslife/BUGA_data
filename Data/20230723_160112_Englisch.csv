2023.07.23;16:02:01;AI Doktor; That sounds like a symptom of migraine headaches. Common symptoms of migraines include a throbbing, pulsating sensation on one side of your head as well as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. If you are having these symptoms, it would be advised to speak with your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
