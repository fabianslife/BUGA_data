2023.09.27;17:45:59;AI Doktor; Hello there. Hypothyroidism is a condition caused by an underactive thyroid gland, which is also known as Hashimotoâ€™s disease. It can affect your energy levels, digestion, and metabolism. Common symptoms are fatigue, weight gain, depression, and dry skin. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to visit your doctor for evaluation. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, taking medications, and dietary changes.
2023.09.27;17:46:37;User;what plants can help with hashimoto
2023.09.27;17:46:39;AI Doktor; Plants are a great way to help manage Hashimoto's disease. Certain herbs such as licorice root, ashwagandha and nettle leaf can help to support your thyroid. Vitamins and minerals such as selenium, iodine, zinc and omega-3 fatty acids can also be beneficial. Additionally, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, kale, and cauliflower can help manage Hashimoto's.
2023.09.27;17:47:12;User;what should i avoid as a hashimoto patient
2023.09.27;17:47:13;AI Doktor; As a patient with Hashimoto's, there are certain things that you should avoid or limit. It is important to avoid processed foods, refined sugars, trans-fats, alcohol, gluten, and soy. You should also limit your intake of dairy and caffeine. Additionally, it may be beneficial to avoid cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower.
2023.09.27;17:47:51;User;but you mentioned that broccoli and cauliflower can help manage hashimoto and now you're saying it may be beneficial to avoid them can you please explain that
2023.09.27;17:47:53;AI Doktor; The key is to be mindful of the amount of cruciferous vegetables you consume. Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower, contain a type of compound called goitrogens. Goitrogens can interfere with thyroid hormone production, so if you have Hashimoto's it is advisable to limit the amount of these foods you consume. That said, these plant-based foods can still be beneficial when consumed in moderate amounts.
