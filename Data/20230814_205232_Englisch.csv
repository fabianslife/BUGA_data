2023.08.14;20:55:09;AI Doktor; Yes, skin color can affect the absorption of transdermal medications. Different skin colors absorb medications at different rates.

2023.08.14;20:55:55;User;can you give me more information on that
2023.08.14;20:55:58;AI Doktor; Yes, the rate of absorption of transdermal medications can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the thickness of the epidermis, pH level of the skin, chemical composition of the medication, and the presence of sweat or oils on the skin. Darker skin colors tend to have an increased barrier effect that may reduce the rate of absorption. In addition, the temperature and location of the medication can also affect its absorption, so it is important to consult your healthcare provider to ensure the medication is being applied correctly.
