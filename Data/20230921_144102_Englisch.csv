2023.09.21;14:41:33;AI Doktor; Unfortunately, no, eating watermelon will not help treat your cold. But eating a healthy, balanced diet with foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants can help boost your immune system and help your body fight off the cold. You should also make sure to drink plenty of fluids and get enough rest. That will help your body fight off the infection.
