2023.09.03;17:27:21;User;why am i allergic to so many things
2023.09.03;17:27:24;AI Doktor;It's often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of allergies, but they are usually a result of a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Some people have a sensitive immune system that is more likely to respond to certain substances as allergens. Treatment will depend upon the type of allergy you have - it could be an avoidance of the allergen, use of antihistamines, corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, or other immunomodulators. It would be best to talk to your doctor about the best treatment for your individual case.
