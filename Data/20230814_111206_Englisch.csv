2023.08.14;11:13:04;AI Doktor; AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It is the ability of computer software and machines to think and solve complex problems just like a human would. AI can analyze large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and draw conclusions in a way that no human can. AI is used in many different medical applications such as diagnostics, treatment planning, and even robotic surgery.

It is important to be certain that you are medically healthy and mentally prepared before making such a life-changing decision.

2023.08.14;11:14:16;AI Doktor;No, AI cannot live on its own. AI algorithms are programmed to selectively search for patterns and make decisions based on those patterns. AI systems require researchers and computer scientists to create and program them, and to fine-tune and monitor their performance. While AI may be able to do some tasks autonomously, it cannot live on its own without human input and control.
