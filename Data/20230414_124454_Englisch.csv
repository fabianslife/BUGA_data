Your doctor may order diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or an abdominal ultrasound to help diagnose the cause. Once a diagnosis is made, they can develop an appropriate treatment plan.

2023.04.14;12:46:39;AI Doktor; I would recommend making an appointment with your primary care physician as soon as possible to address your symptoms. They will be able to assess your condition and develop a treatment plan based on their diagnosis. In the meantime, an over-the-counter pain reliever can be taken to help reduce the discomfort you are experiencing. Additionally, drinking plenty of fluids, eating a balanced diet, and getting adequate rest can help alleviate symptoms.
