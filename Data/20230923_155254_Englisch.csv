I suggest that you see a doctor to have them examine your ankles and assess the underlying cause. Depending on the cause, the doctor may suggest exercises, medications, or even surgery to treat the pain.

2023.09.23;15:53:42;AI Doktor; To recover from ankle pain after running, it's important to rest, ice, and compress the legs. Icing the ankles can reduce inflammation and reduce pain. Additionally, compression can help reduce swelling. It's also important to take over-the-counter pain relievers and elevate your feet above the level of your heart. Stretching and strengthening exercises can also help reduce pain and improve mobility.
