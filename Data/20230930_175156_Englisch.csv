2023.09.30;17:53:15;AI Doktor; This could be caused by seasonal allergies, a cold, or a sinus infection. I recommend seeking further medical advice from a physician, as they would be able to assess your situation and provide a better diagnosis. In the meantime, I suggest you practice self-care and try to reduce your exposure to any allergens that may be triggering your symptoms.
